<p><img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0267/3373/files/cryptogeddon_-_logo_large.png?253" alt="" />Cryptogeddon combines two words: Crypto is short for cryptography, which is the practice and study of hiding information. Geddon is short for armageddon, which infers end times in some way. Cryptogeddon suggests the end of secrets and what that might entail.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.2;">Cryptogeddon is an online cyber security war game that challenges you, the reader, to apply infosec tools and techniques to solve technology puzzles - an online scavenger hunt, if you will.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.2;">We publish mission packs, each of which is sold as a short pdf ebook of about 20 to 30 pages. After purchasing, you will receive a link via email to download your digital files.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.2;">Each mission pack provides an infosec scenario, a set of objectives and links to various digital assets that you use to solve each mission. Each mission pack also comes with a detailed solution that outlines which tools to use and how to apply the tools to solve the mission.</span></p>
