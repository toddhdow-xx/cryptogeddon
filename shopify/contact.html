<p>If you have any questions, comments or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me directly. I appreciate your feedback (good and bad) and I want to make sure that your visit to my site has been a positive experience. Please do reach out if there is anything I can do to make things better, to resolve an issue you may be having or to simply tell me that you like what you see.</p>

<p>I do my best to respond to your notes as quickly as possible, but as a rule, you should expect to hear back from me within 24 hours. Weekends or holidays may delay a response, but I will do my best to get back to you as quickly as possible. And, once or twice a year, I may be away for a few days for vacation, so responses may be slower during that period. If you don't hear for me within 3 business days, feel free to send a follow up note to remind me about your message.</p>

<p>Thank you for your visit to my site. I appreciate your visit and I hope you'll come back again soon.</p>
