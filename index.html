<h1><img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="images/cryptogeddon-logo.gif" alt="" />About Cryptogeddon</h1>
<p>Cryptogeddon combines two words: Crypto is short for cryptography, which is the practice and study of hiding information. Geddon is short for armageddon, which infers end times in some way. Cryptogeddon suggests the end of secrets and what that might entail.</p>
<p><span>Cryptogeddon is an online cyber security war game that challenges you, the reader, to apply infosec tools and techniques to solve technology puzzles - an online scavenger hunt, if you will.</span></p>
<p><span>We publish mission packs, each of which is sold as a short pdf ebook of about 20 to 30 pages. After purchasing, you will receive a link via email to download your digital files.</span></p>
<p><span>Each mission pack provides an infosec scenario, a set of objectives and links to various digital assets that you use to solve each mission. Each mission pack also comes with a detailed solution that outlines which tools to use and how to apply the tools to solve the mission.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are drawn to puzzles, infosec, cryptography or computers, then you will enjoy Cryptogeddon. The challenges presented by each mission will keep you engaged, entertained and enlightened. If you're looking to test your skills, expand your knowledge and learn more about these topics, then you're in the right place.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Cryptogeddon aims to highlight the boundaries of privacy and to reinforce the fact that very little can be kept secret anymore.</p>

<h1>About the Author</h1>

<p>Cryptogeddon was created by me, Todd Dow. I’m an author, geek &amp; CF fundraiser. My wife, my kids, faith, baseball, infosec &amp; devops are a few of my favourite things.</p>
<p>Professionally, I specialize in information security, risk management and IT operations. I have earned my Certified Information Systems Auditor (<a href="http://www.isaca.org/Certification/CISA-Certified-Information-Systems-Auditor/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" title="CISA  - Certified Information Systems Auditor - an ISACA certification">CISA</a>) and Project Management Professional (<a href="http://www.pmi.org/" target="_blank" title="PMP - Project Management Professional - a PMI certification">PMP</a>) designations. I participate in various local conferences and groups (<a title="Sector" href="http://sector.ca/" rel="noreferrer">Sector</a>, <a title="SC Congress Toronto 2013" href="http://congress.scmagazine.com/page.cfm/link=10" rel="noreferrer">SC Congress</a>, <a href="http://www.task.to/" rel="noreferrer">TASK</a>) and I follow numerous infosec initiatives, including <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/" rel="noreferrer">TrueCrypt</a>, <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/" rel="noreferrer">Backtrack</a>, <a href="http://www.kali.org/" rel="noreferrer">Kali</a>, <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/" rel="noreferrer">BlackHat</a> and <a href="http://computer-forensics.sans.org/" rel="noreferrer">SANS Computer Forensics</a>. As a point of personal pride, I won a prize for being in the top 3 participants within the first hour of a three hour hack night at a <a title="Symantec Cyber Readiness Challenge" href="http://www.symantec.com/page.jsp?id=cyber-readiness-challenge" rel="noreferrer">Symantec Cyber Readiness Challenge</a> in Toronto in 2012. Unfortunately, I did not place in the top 3 at the end of the night – I got tripped up by a stupid mistake early in the competition that slowed my progress.</p>
<p>I earned my Honours Computer Systems Technology Diploma from <a title="Mohawk College" href="http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/" rel="noreferrer">Mohawk College</a> in 1997. As well, I earned my Specialist Honours Degree in Philosophy and Religious Studies from the <a title="University of Toronto" href="http://www.utoronto.ca/" rel="noreferrer">University of Toronto</a> in 2006. Additionally, I have completed some graduate work at <a title="McMaster Divinity College" href="http://www.mcmasterdivinity.ca/" rel="noreferrer">McMaster Divinity College</a>. Previously, I earned my second degree black belt in the martial arts of karate, tae kwon do and jiu jitsu. This grounding in both eastern and western philosophical and religious traditions has provided a breadth and depth of experience that I bring to my writing and critical thinking.</p>
<p>One last thing… I work at Postmedia as a Senior Digital Specialist. This site is not related to, nor does it reflect the views of my employer.</p>
<p>Thanks for the visit and stay in touch!</p>
