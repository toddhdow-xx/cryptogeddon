Cryptogeddon combines two words: Crypto is short for cryptography, which is the practice and study of hiding information. Geddon is short for armageddon, which infers end times in some way. Cryptogeddon suggests the end of secrets and what that might entail.<BR>
Cryptogeddon is an online cyber security war game that challenges you, the reader, to apply infosec tools and techniques to solve technology puzzles - an online scavenger hunt, if you will.<BR>
We publish mission packs, each of which is sold as a short pdf ebook of about 20 to 30 pages. After purchasing, you will receive a link via email to download your digital files.<BR>
Each mission pack provides an infosec scenario, a set of objectives and links to various digital assets that you use to solve each mission. Each mission pack also comes with a detailed solution that outlines which tools to use and how to apply the tools to solve the mission.<BR>
If you are drawn to puzzles, infosec, cryptography or computers, then you will enjoy Cryptogeddon. The challenges presented by each mission will keep you engaged, entertained and enlightened. If you're looking to test your skills, expand your knowledge and learn more about these topics, then you're in the right place.<BR>
Ultimately, Cryptogeddon aims to highlight the boundaries of privacy and to reinforce the fact that very little can be kept secret anymore.<BR>
